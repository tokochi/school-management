## Some technical information



The structure of the project was based on this amazing plugin [electron-vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-vite) , that helped me with the initial structure of the project, and a faster Electron Dev environement.



With some changes, was possible to make the Project more clear, separating the modules of front-end from the back-end, what also made the process of perform the build process more easier.
